Show variables for Gitlab pipelines
===================================
![screenshot](/info/screen.png)

A Firefox extension that injects table in pipeline info well.
This information is not available (yet) in the Gitlab UI, but is available in the API, which is what the extension uses.

Works on self-hosted instances - regexp `^https://gitlab([.a-z-]+)/...`

Fork of the [Northern.tech](https://gitlab.com/Northern.tech/OpenSource/gitlab-show-pipeline-variables) extension.
